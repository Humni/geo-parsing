# Geo Parsing

## Requirements
Python 3.9 (other versions are untested)
You must be running the docer container "rahulbot/cliff-clavin" on port 8080 to run the geo-parser

Link on how to setup the docker container: https://github.com/mediacloud/cliff-docker


## How to Run
In the same directoy as your `input.csv` file, run `main.py`. This will generate an `output.csv` with your geoparsed data. The CLI will provide updates as you progress. 

```
main.py
```
